I suggest doing a cronjob for this script, or you can run it manually.

The script get some states via ADB (```adb-tools``` must be installed on machine) and send it to your OpenHAB instance (or something else).

On the Android Device must "Enable ADB over Network" be checked (not all Android devices have this option)
